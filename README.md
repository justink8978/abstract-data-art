My Abstract Data Art Project!
# Unit 4 - Abstract Art Project

## Introduction

Data visualizations are powerful tools to present information and convey patterns and relationships. Sometimes visualizations are charts or graphs, and other times they are more abstract pieces of art. Your goal is to create a visual representation relating at least two categories from your dataset that engages your viewer and encourages them to learn more about your chosen topic.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data visualization program:

- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use methods in the Math class** – Use one or more methods in the Math class in your program, such as to perform calculations on the values in your dataset and display the results, choose random values from the dataset, or display images or shapes at random locations.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
  Note: This may be abstract! Others do not necessarily need to know what the story or pattern is right away, but you do need to be able to explain it to them.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Dataset

Include a hyperlink to the source of your dataset used for this project. Additionally, provide a short description of each column used from the dataset, and the data type.

Example:


Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedwaelnasef/cars-dataset

autoNamesArray (String array) - Names of automatic cars.
manNamesArray (String array) - Names of manual cars.
autoSpeedsArray (double array) - Speeds of automatic cars.
manSpeedsArray (double array) - Speeds of manual cars.
colorsArray (String array) - Colors used in the display

I made updates on a google form for automatic and manual cars.

## UML Diagram

Put and image of your UML Diagram here. Upload the image of your UML Diagram to your repository, then use the Markdown syntax to insert your image here. Make sure your image file name is one work, otherwise it might not properly get display on this README.

## Video Demo

Record a short video of your abstract art animation to display here on your README. You can do this by:

- Screen record your project running on Code.org.
- Upload that recording to YouTube.
- Take a thumbnail for your image.
- Upload the thumbnail image to your repo.
- Use the following markdown

## Description

My project is an app that makes a data visualization for people interested in looking at or buying new cars. It utilizes object-oriented programming, algorithms, and 1D arrays to compare automatic and manual cars. It traverses a dataset of car information which includes names, speeds, and it calculates the averages and top speed of each car type. As for the scanner class, the user utilizes it to select the car transmission type and which number car to pick. Some examples of the visualizations include images, colors, and text.
